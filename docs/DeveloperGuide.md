## Design

### Main Components of the Architecture

This section describes the overall design architecture of _Kolinux_.

The `Main` class is responsible for initializing the main components upon start-up of the application, and 
deciding the execution path of the application through the main components based on reading the user inputs.

The application consists of the following main components responsible for the high-level execution of a user input:
1. `Kolinux`: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
2. `util`: Collection of utility classes.
   * `util.Ui`: User interface of the application.
   * `util.Parser`: Makes sense from the user input and decides which `Command` class to initialize.
   * `util.DirectoryCreator`: Ensures the `/data` directory is created and present for data storage.
   * `util.KolinuxLogger`: Logs the user activity into `data/logger.log`.
   * `util.Prompt`: Created when user confirmation is required to perform certain operations.
3. `commands`: Collection of user commands that determines execution.
4. `routes`: Collection of classes used by Bus Route Finder feature.
5. `module`: Collection of classes used by Module Manager feature.
6. `timetable`: Collection of classes used by Timetable feature.
7. `planner`: Collection of classes used by Planner feature.
8. `capcalculator`: Collection of classes used by CAP Calculator feature.

The architecture diagram below shows a high-level overview of the structure between different components. 

‚ùï _Note: Each component is coded with a different colour and the same colour coding is applied to the rest of this 
document._

![Overview Architecture Diagram](assets/images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

#### Commands Component

The class diagram below describes the structure of the `commands` component.

‚ùï _Note: XYZCommand in this diagram represents HelpCommand, ExitCommand, and InvalidCommand._

![Commands Class Diagram](assets/images/CommandsClassDiagram.png)

All `Command` classes inherit from the abstract `Command` class, which has an association with `KolinuxLogger` so that
every command execution has a corresponding log in `data/logger.log`. `Command` also has a dependency on `Prompt`,
which functions to seek user confirmation below proceeding with the operation. Only `PlannerCommand` is using this
inherited attributed in the current version. The structure between each individual command and other components are 
also shown in the diagram above. These structures will be further elaborated in the sections below.

#### Module Component

The class diagram below models the structure of the `module` component

<img src="assets/images/ModuleClassDiagram.png" align="left">



The `ModuleCommand` class is responsible for the execution of all `module` related commands. It inherits references 
to instances of `ModuleList` and `ModuleDb` from `Command`  which are utilized for maintaining a list of
`ModuleDetails` instances and operating a database of `moduleDetails`( `ModuleDb`) respectively. `ModuleCommand` 
also interacts with `ModuleListStorage` to facilitate the persistent storage of the contents of `ModuleList`. 

#### Timetable Component

The class diagram below describes the structure within in the `timetable` component

![Timetable Class Diagram](assets/images/TimetableClassDiagram.png)

The `Timetable` class is the main part in this component that is responsible for all `timetable` related command 
executions. `Timetable` maintains a list of all `Lesson`s in `lessonStorage` and an association with
`TimetableStorage` for storage of `Lesson` data in `data/timetable.txt`.`Lesson` has 3 types `Tutorial`, 
`Lecture` and `Lab` which are specified by its lesson type, `TUT`, `LEC` and `LAB` respectively. 
`AddSubCommand`, `DeleteSubCommand`, `UpdateSubCommand` and `ViewSubCommand` are called to execute 
`timetable add`, `timetable delete`, `timetable update` and `timetable view` commands respectively.

#### Planner Component

The class diagram below describes the structure within the `planner` component.

![Planner Class Diagram](assets/images/PlannerClassDiagram.png)

The `Planner` class is the main part in this component that is responsible for all `planner` related command
executions. The `Planner` maintains a list of all existing `Event`s, and an association with `PlannerStorage` for
storage of `Event`s data in `data/planner.txt`. To communicate with other components such as `timetable` and `module`,
the `ModuleSyncer` and `ExamsGetter` are the main bridges to fetch `Lesson`s and exams data for `Planner`.

#### CAP Calculator Component

The class diagram below describes the structure between `CapCalculator` and its subclasses.

![CapCalculator Class Diagram](assets/images/CapCalculatorClassDiagram.png)

The `CapCalculator` is an abstract representation of calculator which is inherited by every calculator classes.
It contains the list of modules whose grade are being retrieved to calculate the overall cap within 
`CalculatorModuleList`, which is a subclass of `ModuleList` designed specifically for `CapCalculator`. Its subclasses
can be divided into two groups based on the module format, namely `CapCalculatorByMc` which calculates cap of modules
containing only the modular credit and the corresponding grade, and `CapCalculatorByCode` and its subclasses which can
retrieve modular credit of each module from `moduleDb` for the calculation.

#### Bus Routes Finder Component
The class diagram below describes the interaction between `Route` and its subclasses.

![BusRoute Class Diagram](assets/images/BusRouteClassDiagram.png)

The `Route` class is a higher level representation of the process to find routes. The `DirectRoute` and `IndirectRoute`
classes inherit from the `Route` class. The `BusRouteCommand` instantiates `DirectRoute` and `IndirectRoute` objects.
The `DirectRoute` class is responsible to check if there are any direct or direct alternate routes between the 2 user 
given bus stops. The `IndirectRoute` class is responsible to find if there are any indirect routes between the 2 user 
given bus stops, i.e a route wherein a user will need to switch buses at an intermediate bus stop. The process of checking
whether 2 points on a graph are connected is facilitated by the `Graph` class and achieves this process by using BFS. A
`Location` class object is instantiated by the `BusRouteCommand` class if the user wants to view the list of all bus stops
in the network.

### Command Execution

The sequence diagram below shows a high-level overview of the interaction between entities during the execution
of a user input _(XYZCommand represents any class that inherits from Command)_.

![Overview Sequence Diagram](assets/images/OverviewSequenceDiagram.png)

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how some features are implemented along with more detailed
representations of the interactions between components.

### Add to timetable feature

The timetable add mechanism is facilitated by `Timetable` where the format of the input is as such: 
`timetable add MODULE_CODE/LESSON_TYPE/DAY/START_TIME/END_TIME`. The lessons added to `Timetable` 
via `inputLesson(String[] lessonDetails)` is stored in the `lessonStorage` within the program via 
the method `addLesson(Lesson lesson)` and locally in `TimetableStorage` which saves it 
to `timetable.txt` file to constantly save the lessons' data. It implements the following operations:

* `Timetable#inputLesson(String[] lessonDetail)` containing `Timetable#addLesson(Lesson lesson)` - Adds the lesson 
to `timetableStorage` based on the type of lesson it is, which is included in the lessonDetail.
* `TimetableStorage#writeToFile()` - Saves the lesson details to `timetable.txt` locally.

#### ‚ùï Notes about the methods:

* `String[] lessonDetails` consists of `MODULE_CODE`, `LESSON_TYPE` (`TUT` - tutorial, `LEC` - lecture or `LAB` - lab), 
`DAY`, `START_TIME`, `END_TIME`. 
* Lesson class is inherited by `Tutorial`, `Lecture` and `Lab` to add lessons based on the `LESSON_TYPE` as shown 
in the example below.

Given below are the examples of the usage of `timetable add` of lessons to the timetable.

Example 1: Adding a tutorial to the `lessonStorage` ( lesson of type `TUT` )

![Example 1](assets/images/timetableAdd1.png)

Example 2: Adding a lecture to the `lessonStorage` ( lesson of type `LEC` )

![Example 2](assets/images/timetableAdd2.png)

Example 3: Adding a lab to the `lessonStorage` ( lesson of type `LAB` )

![Example 3](assets/images/timetableAdd3.png)

The following sequence diagrams shows the `timetable add` mechanism:

‚ùïNote: The sequence diagram for the add mechanism has been split into 2 parts for better readability:
* The following diagram shows the sequence of parsing the user input and executing `TimetableCommand#addLesson()`
for the `timetbale add` command

![Sequence Diagram1](assets/images/TimetableAddSequenceDiagram1.png)

* The following diagram shows the sequence of adding the specified lesson from the user input to the 
timetable via `Timetable#executeAdd(lessonDetails)` which is then written to the `timetable.txt` storage 
file via `TimetableStorage#writeToFile()`

![Sequence Diagram2](assets/images/TimetableAddSequenceDiagram2.png)

* There are checks done before adding to the timetable and one of them is the 
`AddSubCommand#isLessonInModuleList(moduleList, moduleCode)`. This integrates `Timetable` and `ModuleList` which 
ensures a module's lessons being added to the timetable has its `moduleCode` first added to the `ModuleList` 
else it will throw an exception to add the module.

```
    private boolean isLessonInModuleList(ModuleList moduleList, String moduleCode) {
        for (ModuleDetails module : moduleList.myModules) {
            if (Objects.equals(module.moduleCode, moduleCode)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
* Another check done is to check if the slot between `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` is not occupied by another lesson,
likewise it will throw an exception.

```
    private boolean isPeriodFree(int startIndex, int endIndex, int dayIndex) throws KolinuxException {
        try {
            for (int i = startIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {
                if (timetableData[i][dayIndex] != null) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception) {
            throw new KolinuxException(INVALID_HOURS_INPUT);
        }
    }
```
* The following sequence diagram illustrates both these checks.

![Sequence Diagram2](assets/images/TimetableAddSequenceDiagram3.png)

### Add to Planner feature

The Add to Planner mechanism is mainly facilitated by `PlannerCommand` and `Planner`. After entering the appropriate
input to add an `Event` to the `Planner`, `PlannerCommand` is constructed with `subCommand` `"add"` and the
relevant `parsedArguments`. The constructor of `PlannerCommand` involves creation of `Planner` and `PlannerStorage`
to initialize the adding and writing to file operations.

Before the `Event` is added, it is first checked for any time conflicts with existing events/lessons/exams. `Event`s
are only added if there are no time conflicts or the user allowed the addition of the conflicted `Event` through a
`Prompt` to get a confirmation from the user. `Event`s added to the `Planner` are stored in a list
`scheduleOfAllDates` which contains all added `Event`s by the user. The data in this list is also written to the
internal storage `data/planner.txt` through `PlannerStorage` which saves the user data locally.

This mechanism is implemented by the following methods:
* `Planner#addEvent(Event event, boolean allowConflict)`: Attempts to add `event` to `scheduleOfAllDates` by invoking
the following methods:
    * `Planner#hasTimeConflict(Event event)`: Checks for any time conflicts between `event` and any existing `Event`s
      in `scheduleOfAllDates`, lessons, and exams.
    * `PlannerStorage#writeFile(String data)`: Appends the data of the newly added `Event` to `data/planner.txt` for 
      local storage.

* `PlannerCommand#getReplyFromPrompt(String question)`: Gets user confirmation to allow or cancel the add operation
in case of a time conflict.

The figures below represent the sequence diagrams of the Add to Planner mechanism:

![Planner Sequence Diagram 1](assets/images/PlannerAddSequenceDiagram1.png)

![Planner_Sequence_Diagram_2](assets/images/PlannerAddSequenceDiagram2.png)

The `Planner#hasTimeConflict(Event event)` method is integrated with `Timetable` and `ModuleList` so that `Lesson`s and
exams may be fetched in addition to `scheduleOfAllDates` containing the `Event`s to check time conflicts against. The
integration in the method is mainly done via the `Planner#filterPlanner(String date)` call. The code snippet below
shows how `Planner#hasTimeConflict(Event event)` invokes `Planner#filterPlanner(String date)`. The return value
`filteredPlanner` will contain all the existing events/lessons/exams occurring on the date of the `event` that 
is to be added.

```
    private boolean hasTimeConflict(Event eventToBeAdded) {
        ArrayList<Event> filteredPlanner = filterPlanner(eventToBeAdded.getDate());
        String startTime = eventToBeAdded.getStartTime();
        String endTime = eventToBeAdded.getEndTime();
        for (Event event : filteredPlanner) {
            if (!(startTime.compareTo(event.getEndTime()) >= 0 || endTime.compareTo(event.getStartTime()) <= 0)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

The main working mechanism of `Planner#filterPlanner(String date)` is as follows:
1. Construct a `ModuleSyncer` object with the `date` specified. The object will populate a list of `Event`s that are
constructed using the information of the lessons and exams occurring on `date` using the data fetched from `Timetable` 
and `ModuleList`. Note that an `ExamsGetter` is used by `ModuleSyncer` to interact with `ModuleList` to get the exam 
dates and times of the modules stored by `ModuleList`.
2. Get the list from `ModuleSyncer`, and add the events in `scheduleOfAllDates` that are occurring on `date` via 
a `Stream`.
3. Return the list.

The list returned will then be used to check for any time conflicts with `eventToBeAdded`.

The object diagrams below show the object structure in the memory before and after `Planner#filterPlanner(String date)` is invoked to 
fetch `Lesson`s and exam information from `Timetable` and `ModuleList` respectively. Assume there is one `Lesson` 
and one exam occurring on the same `date`, and there is one `Event` initially stored in `scheduleOfAllDates`.

![Planner After Object Diagram](assets/images/PlannerObjectDiagramAfter.png)

### Add/delete a module by module code feature

The `ModuleCommand` class extends the `Command` class and handles all module related commands. In the context of storage and deletion, operations are performed of a list of `ModuleDetails` encapsulated in an instance of  `ModuleList` (`moduleList`). The `ModuleList` class implements the following methods to achieve this:

- `ModuleList#addModuleByCode(String code, ModuleDb moduleDb)`
- `ModuleList#deleteModuleByCode(String code)`

‚ùï Notes about the methods:

`moduleDb` is an instance of `ModuleDb` that contains a hashmap, relating each module's code (key) to its respective `ModuleDetails` (value). For storing a module, a `ModuleDetails` instance corresponding to a module code is appended to list in `moduleList`

The input format for storage and deletion of modules is as follows:

- Storage: `module add MODULE_CODE`

- Deletion: `module delete MODULE_CODE`

  

Given below are examples of the usage of `module add/delete` and how the add/delete system behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application. `myModules` , the list of `ModuleDetails` instances, is initialized with the latest saved modules from local storage. If no modules are stored, the resulting list will be empty.

Example: `myModules` is initialized with single `ModuleDetails` instance corresponding to `CS2113T`

<img src="assets/images/moduleListInit.png" width="550">

Step 2: The user executes `module add CS2101` command to store information regarding `CS2101` in a new instance of `ModuleDetails` and append it to `myModules`. The `module add` prefix ensures `ModuleList#addModuleByCode(String code, ModuleDb moduleDb)` is called. 

<img src="assets/images/moduleStore.png" width="550">

Step 3: The user executes `module delete CS2101` command to delete the instance of `ModuleDetais` corresponding to `CS2101` from `myModules`. The `module delete` prefix ensures `ModuleList#deleteModuleByCode(String code)` is called. 

<img src="assets/images/moduleListInit.png" width="550">



The following sequence diagram models how the `module add` operation works:

![Module Add Sequence Diagram](assets/images/ModuleAddSequenceDiagram.png)

The `module delete` operation follows a similar sequence. Instead of calling the ModuleCommand#storeModule() method, the ModuleCommand#deleteModule() method is invoked. internally, this calls the `deleteModuleByCode` method from `moduleList`. All other steps remain the same. 



### CAP Calculator by module code feature

This cap calculation is managed using `CapCalculatorByCode`. It extends `CapCalculator` which stores
the input modules and grades from user as a `CalculatorModuleList`, which is a subclass of `ModuleList` 
dedicated for cap calculation. 

When the command `cap code` is given by the user, the constructor is called to retrieve and store the modules 
from the input. After the object construction is done, `CapCalculator#executeCapCalculator()` method is then 
invoked for the cap calculation. 

In order to achieve these functionalities, the following methods from `CapCalculatorByCode` are invoked.

* `CapCalculatorByCode#getInputModules(String input)` ‚Äî which retrieves the module codes and grades from String input
and store them as `CalculatorModuleList`
* `CapCalculatorByCode#getCap()` ‚Äî which is the methods used to do all the cap calculation.

In addition, the following methods implemented in `CapCalculator` are also invoked to ensure an error-free
functionality.

* `CapCalculator#executeCommand()` ‚Äî which is an overridden method from `Command` is used to facilitate cap calculation
and exception handling methods.
* `CapCalculator#checkModulesNotEmpty()` ‚Äî which ensures that the module list of the object is not empty.
* `CapCalculator#checkInvalidModules()` ‚Äî which checks if there are any invalid modules after the cap calculation.

Below is the sequence diagrams showing important steps of how `cap code` operates:

![Cap Code Sequence Diagram 1](assets/images/capCodeSeq1.png)

![Cap Code Sequence Diagram 2](assets/images/capCodeSeq2.png)

![Cap Code Sequence Diagram 3](assets/images/capCodeSeq3.png)

### Bus routes feature
The bus routes feature is facilitated by the `BusRouteCommand` class. The `BusRouteCommand` class extends the `Command` class. 
When the user invokes and uses the bus routes feature the `BusRouteCommand` class instantiates either a `Location` class 
object or `DirectRoute` and `IndirectRoute` class object depending on the user input. The operation is implemented in the 
following way.

* `Location#getBusStopList()` - Displays the list of all bus stops within the NUS internal bus service routes.
* `DirectRoute#checkDirectRoutes(ArrayList<String> busNumbers)` - Checks whether there is a direct bus route between the 2 user given bus stops.
* `IndirectRoute#checkIndirectRoutes(ArrayList<String> busOne, ArrayList<String> busTwo, ArrayList<String> midLoc)` - Checks whether there is an alternate route between the 2 user given bus stops which requires a single change of bus at an intermediate bus stop.
* `DirectRoute#checkAlternateDirectRoutes(Arraylist<String> busNumbers)` - Checks whether there is a direct alternate route which involves finding a route from an opposite bus stop (if it exists) to the final location.
* `Route#getBusStopNumber()` - Converts the user given bus stop name into the corresponding vertex number present in the graph route text file
* `Graph#isConnected(int u, int v)` - Helps to check if 2 vertices in a graph are connected by a path using the BFS algorithm. All the methods which facilitates checking for routes call this method from the class `Graph`.

‚ùï Some points about the graph. 
* Each bus route has its own graph and the information is stored in text files and are loaded after the `Route` class constructor is called.
* Graphs are modelled by taking each bus stop and assigning it a vertex number. 
* A single bus stop may have different vertex numbers on different graphs.
* Vertex numbers range from 0 to n - 1, where n is the total number of bus stops in the particular route

The following sequence diagram gives an overview of the bus routes feature.

![sequenceDiagram](assets/images/BusRouteSequenceDiagram.png)

## Glossary

* *Mainstream OS*: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* *Event*: Personal event added to the Planner by the user
* *Lesson*: Class (Lecture, Tutorial, or Lab) for a particular module added to the Timetable by the user
* *Exam*: Official final examination for a particular module

## Instructions for manual testing

### Storing a module by module code

1. Storing a new module with a valid code

   - Test case: `module add CS2113T`

     Expected:  Initially the module list is empty. One module is added and a success message is printed to standard output.

2. Storing a module with an invalid code (non-existent module)

   - Test case: `module add invalid_module`

     Expected:  There is no module in the database with a code `invalid_module`. An error message is shown, prompting the user to enter a valid module's code.

3. Storing a pre-existing module in the list

   - Test case: `module add CS2113T`

     Expected:  The module list already contains `CS2113T`. Upon encountering a module with a duplicate code, an error message is shown, prompting the user to enter a new module's code.
   
   
   

### Adding an event to Planner

1. Adding an event with no time conflicts with any existing events, lessons, or exams to the Planner.
   

   * Test case: `planner add watch movie/2021-10-20/1800/2100`
   
      Expected: Event is added to the list. Success message printed as output.


   * Test case: `planner add project meeting/20211020/0700/0800`
     
      Expected: Event is not added to the list. Error message regarding date and time format printed as output.


   * Test case: `planner add go back in time/2021-10-20/1400/1300`
   
      Expected: Event is not added to the list. Error message regarding wrong time order printed as output.


   * Other incorrect commands to try: `planner add something wrong//`, `planner add something amazing/ 3pm to 4pm`
     
      Expected: Similar to previous cases where an error message regarding the format of command is printed as output.

2. Adding an event with time conflicts with at least one existing event, lesson, or exam to the Planner.


  * Prerequisites: Add the event by `planner add conflict test/2022-05-05/0800/1100`. Add the module
    `module add cs2113t` and add a lesson `timetable add cs2113t/lec/thursday/1600/1800`.
    _Do note 2021-05-05 is a Thursday._


  * Test case: `planner list 2022-05-05`

     Expected: The event `conflict test`, lesson `CS2113T LEC`, exam `CS2113T Exam` are displayed as output.


  * Test case: `planner add love conflicts/2022-05-05/xxxx/yyyy` where `xxxx` and `yyyy` are start times and end
    times respectively which overlaps with any of the events listed.
   
       Expected: Event is not added to the list. A message will be shown seeking permission to proceed with the
       operation. Entering `y` will lead to a success message, while anything else will lead to the operation cancelled.
